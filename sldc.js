// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  'This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.';
const analysisOfRequirements =
  'Second step, you check to see what you need for the plan to actually work, what tools and tech are going to be best/most helpful';
const design =
  'Third step in which you design what it will look like and how different pieces of product will fit together.';
const implementation =
  'Fourth step, which is the actual code writing and putting everything together.';
const testingIntegration =
  'Fith step, is when you finished the code, and test it to see if it works. And then to integrate is to deploy it and make it available for use';
const maintain =
  'This is the last part, once everything is ready for use, make sure the code is still working properly, and update and debug if needed.';
